## Week 16 Homework Submission File: Penetration Testing 1

#### Step 1: Google Dorking


- Using Google, can you identify who the Chief Executive Officer of Altoro Mutual is: Karl Fitzgerald

- How can this information be helpful to an attacker: Once the attacker knows who the CEO is it will be easier to target information and files with those credentials, once a breach is established. 


#### Step 2: DNS and Domain Discovery

Enter the IP address for `demo.testfire.net` into Domain Dossier and answer the following questions based on the results:

  1. Where is the company located: Massachusetts, US

  2. What is the NetRange IP address: 65.61.137.64 - 65.61.137.127

  3. What is the company they use to store their infrastructure:
     CustName:       Rackspace Backbone Engineering
     Address:        9725 Datapoint Drive, Suite 100
     City:           San Antonio
     StateProv:      TX
     PostalCode:     78229
     Country:        US
    
  4. What is the IP address of the DNS server: '65.61.137.117'

#### Step 3: Shodan

- What open ports and running services did Shodan find: 
  https://www.shodan.io/host/65.61.137.117
  Open Ports: 80, 443, 8080

#### Step 4: Recon-ng

- Install the Recon module `xssed`. 
  > sudo apt-get install xssed
  > apt-get update && apt-get install recon-ng
  > recon-ng
  > marketplace search xssed
  > modules load recon/domains-vulnerabilities/xssed
 
  
- Set the source to `demo.testfire.net`. 
  > options set SOURCE demo.testfire.net
- Run the module. 
  > run

Is Altoro Mutual vulnerable to XSS: Yes, 1 vulnerability was found.

### Step 5: Zenmap

Your client has asked that you help identify any vulnerabilities with their file-sharing server. Using the Metasploitable machine to act as your client's server, complete the following:

- Command for Zenmap to run a service scan against the Metasploitable machine:
  Metasploitable machine IP address is 192.168.0.10
  type 'zenmap' into kali vm command line
  Input Target: 192.168.0.10
  Profile: Quick scan
  > scan
 
 
- Bonus command to output results into a new text file named `zenmapscan.txt`:
  > nmap -T4 -A 192.168.0.10 -oN zenmapscan.txt
- Zenmap vulnerability script command: 

- Once you have identified this vulnerability, answer the following questions for your client:
  1. What is the vulnerability:
Zenmap was able to enumerate the vulnerable service as follows:

  2. Why is it dangerous: The concept of the attack on VSFTPD 2.3. 4 is to trigger the malicious vsf_sysutil_extra(); function by sending a sequence of specific bytes on port 21, which, on successful execution, results in opening the backdoor on port 6200/tcp of the system.

  3. What mitigation strategies can you recommendations for the client to protect their server:
   The VSFTPD 2.3.4 backdoor (CVE-2011-2523) service vulnerability is very unlikly an issue in a live situation because this version of VSFTPD is old now and the vulnerable version was only available for one day. 
   A patch was released by Microsoft for SMB vulnerability in March 2017. Applying SMB patch is the best solution to prevent the vulnerability.
